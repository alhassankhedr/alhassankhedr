# Hi, I'm Alhassan 👋

I'm the founder of [Lorica Cybersecurity](https://loricacyber.com), where I’m building infrastructure for secure, privacy-preserving AI — combining modern model development with encrypted computation and scalable deployment workflows.

🔐 I focus on:

- Confidential computing, FHE, and other privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs)
- Secure, scalable AI infrastructure design

---

### 🚧 Currently in Build Mode

I'm early in my open-source journey and currently laying the groundwork for several upcoming projects, including:

- Secure LLM training and inference pipelines using confidential computing (e.g., AMD SEV-SNP, Azure NCCadsH100v5)
- Infrastructure-as-code (Terraform + Vault + Kubernetes) for privacy-first AI deployments
- Experimental benchmarks evaluating performance tradeoffs of FHE, TEE, and other PETs in real-world AI workflows

I’ll begin publishing code and write-ups here as components mature.

### 🧭 My Mission

AI will shape the future — but only systems designed with built-in security and privacy will be trusted.

At Lorica, I’m working to make **secure-by-default AI** practical for real-world deployment in high-stakes environments like healthcare, defense, and financial services.

### 🤝 Let’s Collaborate

I’m actively looking to connect with researchers and engineers working on:

- Encrypted inference
- Confidential container orchestration
- Secure LLM training workflows

If that’s you, let’s talk.

### ⚡ Outside of Work

You'll find me spending time with family, reading, or watching sci-fi. I also enjoy swimming, rowing and volleyball.
