# Hi, I'm Alhassan 👋

I'm the founder of [Lorica Cybersecurity](https://loricacyber.com), where I’m building infrastructure for secure, privacy-preserving AI — combining modern AI model development with encrypted computation and secure deployment workflows.

🔐 I’m focused on:

- Training and deploying foundation models
- Confidential computing, FHE, and other privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs)
- Building secure, scalable AI infrastructure

---

### 🚧 Currently in Build Mode

I'm early in my open-source journey and laying the groundwork for several upcoming projects, including:

- Secure LLM training and inference pipelines using confidential computing (e.g., AMD SEV-SNP, Azure NCCadsH100v5)
- Infrastructure-as-code (Terraform + Vault + Kubernetes) for privacy-first AI deployments
- Experimental benchmarks evaluating performance tradeoffs of FHE, TEE, and other PETs in real-world AI workflows

I’ll begin publishing code and write-ups here as components stabilize.

If you’re working in this space or thinking about collaboration, feel free to reach out.

### 📚 What I'm Deeply Focused On

- Mastering the foundations of deep learning and model training (PyTorch, optimization strategies)
- Exploring large-scale LLM tooling (DeepSpeed, AXLearn)
- Building production-grade ML infrastructure (Terraform, Vault, Kubernetes, Azure)

---

### 🧭 My Mission

AI will shape the future — but only systems designed with built-in security and privacy will be trusted.

At Lorica, I’m working to make **secure-by-default AI** practical for real-world deployment in high-stakes environments like healthcare, defense, and financial services.

### ⚡ When I'm Not Building

You'll find me spending time with family, reading, or watching sci-fi. I also enjoy rowing and volleyball.
